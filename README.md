# Data Analytics

Data analytics is the science of analyzing raw data in order to make conclusions about that information. Many of the techniques and processes of data analytics have been automated into mechanical processes and algorithms that work over raw data for human consumption.  I have been fortunate enough to work in the Data Analytics area at work, and see the value in continuing to study the various aspects of Data Science and Analytics.
